 Known issues to be resolved

 * more strict validation of input parameters (at the moment, Reksio trusts the User)
 * some automated tests are based on GIT test repo. Those will not run, if someone has not installed git :(
 * tmp directory should be configurable in settings file

 Future ideas

 * Command line utility to list repositories
 * Command line utility to display server status (overall + detailed)
 * Define build stages: configuration, build, test - each having separate command and status
    * Built-in support for TAP::Harness (so Reksio can list tests)
 * Dispatch commands in paralel (run more then one command at once)
 * 'subversion' vcs support
 * Web UI
 * 'archive' vcs support (supporting both file:// and http://)
 * 'ssh' dispatcher
 * 'gearman' dispatcher
 * 'html' reports
 * 'xml' reports
 * 'yaml' reports
 * 'json' reports
 * Web service to get the data
 * Web service to remotely control the server
 * If tests fail, compress working directory and store for later inspection.
 * Ability to 'pause' and 'resume' (starting of) builds
 * Support for branches in GIT
 * Bulk storage - either DB-based or FS-based (configurable)
 * Charts (in Web UI)
